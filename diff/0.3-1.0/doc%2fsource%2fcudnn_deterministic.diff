+.. note::
+
+    In some circumstances when using the CUDA backend with CuDNN, this operator
+    may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is
+    undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at
+    a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic =
+    True``.
+    Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.
